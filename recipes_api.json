{"description":"One of the reasons why I chose to work with the Alzheimer�s Association is because my grandmother had dementia and some of the most meaningful moments I had with her were around the table, sharing a meal. So, I wanted to create a recipe that�s fun, easy, full of flavor, and, most importantly, can be enjoyed together with friends and loved ones. Words alone can�t convey how magnificent, how beautifully ceremonial a whole fish looks when presented at the table. I�m always excited when I and a few friends settle in to devour one. (And devour we do, you should see how little is left when we�re through with it.) Aside from being so good-looking, a whole fish also offers much more flavor because the head and the bones add depth to the accompanying sauce.

The second is to let the dough rest overnight or longer for a more complex, toffee-like flavor. Lastly, use an ice cream scooper to get even-sized cookies every time. And that�s it! With these little tweaks, the result is a cookie that�s textured on the outside, and soft and gooey on the inside.

Every cup of boba milk tea had this signature condensed milk flavor that fused perfectly with the concentrated black tea.

This drink is a thirst-quencher with a great caffeine kick. If you prefer your drinks to be less sweet, reduce the amount of brown sugar syrup or condensed milk during assembly.
